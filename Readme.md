# Your Code As A Crime Scene

Here's my notes about the [book](https://pragprog.com/titles/atcrime/your-code-as-a-crime-scene/) written by Adam Tornhill.  
I am not the author of most of the content available on this repository. I've only regrouped on a single repository every resource I needed to follow the book.

## Chapter 1 : Welcome!

Tools needed for the examples (more details [here](https://adamtornhill.com/code/crimescenetools.htm)):

- [Code maat](https://github.com/adamtornhill/code-maat) (requires Java >= 1.6)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

`scripts` folder contains python scripts for log analysis.  
`sample` folder contains various samples analysed all along the book.

## Chapter 2 : Code as a Crime Scene

Tool: [Code city](http://wettel.github.io/codecity.html)  
Each block is a package, each building a class. The height of a building is defined by the number of methods, and the base by the number of attributes.  

Tool: [MetricsTreeMap](https://github.com/adamtornhill/MetricsTreeMap)  
Size and color of blocks describe how frequently a piece of code is modified.  

By correlating those two dimensions (size of a class and how often it changes), we can identify hotspots that need our attention.
